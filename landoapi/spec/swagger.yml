      confirmation_token:
        type: string
        description: |
          A token to be passed along with the transplant request when the
          caller goes to land a revision.  By receiving and passing the token
          along the caller asserts that they have acknowledged all of the
          warnings. For example, the caller could present a UI with the
          warnings to the end user and have the user acknowledge the warnings
          with a checkbox. Once acknowledged, the UI can pass the confirmation
          token to the transplant endpoint so the transplant can proceed.

          their revision.  The caller can signal acknowledgement by sending the
